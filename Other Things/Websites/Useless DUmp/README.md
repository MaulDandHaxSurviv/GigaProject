# Overview

Pull the ip of any ROBLOX game you are currently in.

# Why

This is an old project I made a couple years back to expand my knowledge of C# and file inspection. It doesn't have any core purpose beyond being a learning opportunity.

# Instructions

1. Open "ROBLOX IP Puller.exe"
2. Join a ROBLOX game
3. Wait until your character has spawned into the game
4. Click "Get Server IP"
5. You should get a popup window with the server's IP.
